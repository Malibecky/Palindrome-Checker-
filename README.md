# Palindrome-Checker-
Build a palindrome checker Project
A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
I have done  this project using javascript and python
